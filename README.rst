Decentralized banking research project
--------------------------------------

Software, protocol and concept study of decentralized banking. This is a community project. Wanna join?

The Idea
--------
Each unit of production it's own currency.
Small-scaled 'value' communities, running their own central banks and trading their own goods for others through many centralized 'local' exchanges. Trading on these exchanges is synchronized, allowing all the parties on the exchange to receive full information before commiting trade.

The amount of stated trust amongst banks', based on the 'real world' countervalue within a value community, together with the dissipation of changes therein through longer trust-chains, determine a bank's and thus a currency's exchange value. This dissipation mechanism should be based on overall value-maximizing algorithms, since the underlying 'real' economy holds the countervalue of the currency which is not to change as a result of intermittent changes.

Principles
----------
* Decentralized multi-homed 'central' banks
* Synchronized 'local' exchanges
* Cryptographic money with 'trusted' countervalue
* Trust is established on exchanges
* Automated trading algorithms for overall value maximization

Tools
-----
* PKI, HTTPS
* Explicit manual trust and account management
* Web front-end
* (Decent mobile compatibility)
* (Interactive OAuth2 payment authentication)
* Django/Python? Ruby on Rails? ASM? ... Java!?

Use cases
---------
1. When person X has to pay Y, X pays Y in a currency shared amongst X and Y. A transfer of units happends within their common bank.
2. When person X has to pay Y and there are no common currencies between them, the currencies will be automatically traded on an exchange shared by banks.
3. Person X deposits an amount of money, gold, stocks, pledges or other valueables at Bank Z. Bank Z uses this value as countervalue to create new units of its currency. It might or might not apply fractional reserve banking or expand other forms of credit.
